Place all scripts and probe files within the scrips folder.  Running the genome_download.sh file will generate 
a genome/Genus_species folder within which all output will be generated.

---------------

1) Run the genome_download.sh script.

This will generate a folder for each species with the complete genome within this folder.

2) Run the generate_blast_db.sh scrript

This will make the genome of each especies searcheable and the diferent types of loci may be extracted from the genomes.

3) Run the extract_loci.sh

This will generate all the different marker types which have to be processed in pyRAD (steps 6 and 7)

4) Run pyRAD to generate input files for analyses.
